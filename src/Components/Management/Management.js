          <p>
            K.Ramakrishnan College of Engineering, Tiruchirappalli has become an
            ideal place for technical education within a short span of time. The
            growth of the institution lies in the performance of the students.
            Institutions should empower the students by developing their skills
            and competency, so that they can fit themselves in the globalized
            market. The prime motto of KRCE “Empower through Education” is
            achieved by providing a inimitable pedagogical approach by the
            committed faculty members and the students by sharing the
            responsibility of both learning and teaching. The college has
            successfully been holding the beacon of learning high in the
            scholastic empyrean and it has been on an assertive journey to
            strengthen the young minds to innovate them with an invincible
            tutelage.
          </p>
          <p>
            Education is not just a process of giving knowledge for a future job
            but a lifelong process which builds an understanding of moral and
            ethical values to guide one’s life in a right path. KRCE not only
            focuses on the academic front, but also helps in the development of
            a student's personality, extra-curricular activities and over all
            perspective. Everything that makes a good institution - well
            equipped R&D Cells, Lab facilities for all the departments, Wi-Fi
            enabled campus, well stacked library with digital facility, career
            guidance, unique teaching methods, training for competitive
            examinations, liberty to think and express themselves – all are
            available to mould the students to face the challenges confidently.
            In the culmination of 12 years of hard work, the institution has
            left no stone unturned in enhancing the pedagogical and
            technological service of its wards.I firmly believe that our
            institution is more than just a place to learn.It provides you a
            chance to grow by equipping with everything you need to achieve
            excellence.I wish all the students for their grand success in their
            career and prosperity.
